===============

This repository is meant as a simples implementation of a static, information only, website generated using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What is used
A stripped down bootstrap is used for typography and layout. (This may change in the future, most likely to refine the files used to achieve the required parts of Bootstrap. Also, if it turns out to be less complicated and of little effort, Bootstrap might be eliminated completely in favor of a leaner solution.)
